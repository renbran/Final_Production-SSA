## INSTRUCTIONS: How to Save the Professional Logo

1. **Save the logo image from the attachment** as:
   `d:\Scholarix Study Website\Final_Production-SSA\public\static\images\scholarix-logo-professional.png`

2. **Ensure the background is transparent** - the logo should have no white or colored background

3. **Recommended settings when saving**:
   - Format: PNG (for transparency support)
   - Resolution: 300 DPI or higher
   - Background: Transparent
   - Size: Approximately 800x400px (will be scaled by CSS)

4. **After saving the logo**, run these commands:

```bash
cd "d:/Scholarix Study Website/Final_Production-SSA"
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=scholarix-study-abroad-v0 --commit-message="Update to professional logo with strategic placement"
```

## Logo Placement Strategy (Already Implemented):

✅ **Navigation Logo**: 85px height - Professional, clean, prominent but not overwhelming
✅ **Footer Logo**: 90px height - Optimized for dark background with white drop shadow
✅ **Contact Form Logo**: 100px height - Enhanced for blue gradient background
✅ **Strategic Positioning**: Proper margins and padding for balanced layout
✅ **Responsive Design**: Scales appropriately on mobile devices
✅ **Enhanced Effects**: Subtle shadows and hover animations for better visibility

The code is ready - just save the logo file and build/deploy!
